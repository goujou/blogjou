## 1. Introduction

- papers are for the readers, not the authors (which in fact is not true): do readers gain novel insights and new knowledge?

### Checklist

- journal's target audience
- methods and analyses support interpretations and conclusions

- conclusions well-grounded in the data and conclusive
- speculation is clearly identified as such
- clear writing

### 2. SBB's criteria are based on our aims and scope

> Soil Biology & Biochemistry publishes scientific research articles of
international significance which describe and explain fundamental
biological and biochemical features and processes occurring in soil
systems.

1. Audience
    - what does the reader already know: leave it out and take it for granted
2. Questions
    - no case studies, only broadly relevant questions
3. Focus and scale
    - drivers of processes of soil biochemistry, not just soil as a "brown box"
4. Novelty and importance
    - well-studied processes in new circumstances or with new methods
    - incremental science: larger synthesis, new insights, deeper understanding
    - show *why* and *how* the work is novel
5.  Language
    - English: AE tends to shorter sentences (laconic authors such as Mark Twain and Ernest Hemmingway), BE tends to longer and more elaborate prose (Jane Austen and Thomas Hardy)

### 3. An Editor's approach: How we apply these standards when we get a manuscript

- first check for: international relevance, fundemantality, soil systems
- language check: title, highlights, opening paragraphs
- **first impressions matter**
- first check happens in short blocks of free time, if there are problems the paper is put on the backburner

#### Common issues that lead to a "Desk Reject"

1. Telling the wrong story
    - message must meet the journal's scope
    - opening paragraph defines a problem to solve
    - conclusions will come back to this problem
    - opening problem defines target audience
    - **for SBB: be general here!**

2. No real question or hypothesis
    - define specific objectives at end of introduction: **What question will you answer?**
    - identify a knowledge gap
    - be as precise as possible

3. Poor presentation
    - read the *Guide to Authors*
    - use little color, good palettes, large font sizes, line numbers

4. Weak conclusions
    - show what the work has contributed and has it has advanced understanding
    - avoid "more research is needed...": point out what you *have* done, not what you have *not* done
    - discuss limitations earlier
    - be precise, *what* are the exact implications?
    - **"Show, don't tell".**
    - first and last words are most powerful

### 4. Conclusions
- check journal's scope
- read as an editor/reviewer/reader
- **ironically, typo "concecus" in last words of the paper**
