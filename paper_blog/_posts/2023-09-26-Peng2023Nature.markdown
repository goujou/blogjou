## Abstract
- counting newly grown wood from harvested forests as extra is wrong because this growth would also happen without harvesting
- harvesting forests leads until 2050 to additional eCO$_2$ in the realms of land use change due to agricultural expansion

## Main text
- depending on how you count, harvesting wood might not be just C neutral but even benefit the climate
- reporting at national level allows countries to look C neutral
- harvesting should decrease this benefit, but is not reported separately
- net increase in forest C makes countries appear to have no emissions
- reporting net effects of new wood harvests and regrowth from previous harvests leads to similar effects (no identification of effects of new wood harvests alone)
- appears that harvesting in temperate countries is beneficial and in tropical countries it is costly (in terms of climate)
- **wrong accounting**: Growth that would occur anyway cannot offset harvesting costs.
- **so far**: mostly spatial offsetting, or offsetting with past growth
- **possible**: offsetting with what grows in the same place **after** the harvest
- **harvests lead to short-term emissions and undermine Paris Agreement**

## Accounting for time in estimation of GHG costs
- **CHARM (carbon harvest model)**: new global forest C model
    - live vegetation, roots, slash, different wood products and landfills
- computes annual difference in scenarios: forest would have grown, forest is harvested
- emissions discounted with 4% per year: the earlier the heavier
- **SCC (social carbon costs)**: for instance cost for mitigation might decreaste with better technology
- mitigation now is more valuable (costly), already included in the discount
- discount can be seen as interest rate for companies on today's emissions, they will have to pay back more later

## Growing wood demand
- long-lived wood products (LLP): sawn wood, wood panels, and other industrial roundwood
- short-lived wood products (SLP): paper and papaerboard products
- very-short-lived products-wood fuel (VSLP-WFL): wood harvedted deliberately for energy
- very-short-lived products-industrial (VSLP-IND): waste from manufacture of other wood products, burned for energy
- wood harvests will increase by 54% globally between 2010 nd 2050, mostly SLP; VSLP-WFL most uncertain
- substituton effects for steal and concrete
- "clear-cut-equivalents": area necessary by clearcutting to get the same amount of wood
- nice flow-chart of wood products

## Robustness of results
- 3-5 GtCO$_2$e  per year
- probably conservative: effects of harvests on soil C not counted: meta-analyses show quite some soil C loss
- indirect effects such as road building ignored (can be several times direct effects)

## Insensivity to discount rate
- robust if society has a small preference for short-term over long-term mitigation

## Meaning of economic effects
- Compare harvesting with no human activity instead of another human activity such as land use change, otherwise you are covolving numbers.

## A potential mitigation option
- harvesting comes with carbon costs, offsetting is usually done in wrong ways
- comparing them with land-use change due to agricultural expansion makes costs disappear, because costs are about equal
- **No harvesting mitigates climate change.**
- Later, mature forests might sink in C slower, but no harvesting now would buy us time.
