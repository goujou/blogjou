I am not sure where this project belongs.
It is not like classically reading a paper and it is not about classically citing some quotes of enjoyable books.
For starters, I would like to note my impressions.
I need to study physics to understand the simplest of Bohm's arguments, I do not have the time, and the energy to do so fainted as well.
So I try to make the best of it and note down what I feel most interesting.

## Chapter 1

- in three dimensions, a [transverse wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_wave) (the link helped me a lot to understand the concept of polarization) has two options for polarization
    - Are there always $d-1$ options for polarization if $d$ is the space dimension?
    - What is a longitudinal wave?
- Maxwell's equations and Fourier mathematics lead to a perfect blackbody radiation theory, as long as the frequency is not too high (Rayleigh-Jeans law)
    - Fourier mathematics, as is mentioned in a footnote on page 10, works as long as the function is piecewise continuous, which I find a pretty remarkable footnote in the realms of the borderline between classical physics and quantum mechanics
- both Maxwell's equations and Fourier mathematics are undisputable, but something is wrong when it comes to measurements at high frequencies
- Max Planck (Einstein is also mentioned, Nobel Prize?) comes with the idea, that quantized energy packets might do the trick
- it was not ovious earlier noted because the frequency-dependent package size $\h\,\nu$ is small enough to make quantum theory look continuous at not too high frequencies
- Maxwell's distribution reconciles both the Rayleigh-Jeans law and the Wiener law, his new law interpolates even everything in between very well
- most of the things are just greek to me but I hope I got the gist
