## Abstract
- high NSC sign for oversupply or necessary for survivial or inaccessible?
- NSC about 10% dry plant biomass, higesht in leaves, lowest in stem
- strong depletion during growing season
- high in conifers with relatively high seasonal minimum
- starch as future reservoir, soluble sugars for immediate functions (osmoregulation)

## Introduction
- non-structural carbon compounds (NCC)
    - NSC: starch, soluble sugars, fructants (in some herbs)
    - neutral lipids (in some taxa)
- role as storage: support night metabolism, support in stressful periods
- starch might be depleted, soluble sugars need to be above a certain threshold for everyday functions like phloem transport, turgor stability, ...
- size of soluble sugars threshold unknown
- NSC lower in stems because of more lignins and non-living tissue

## Methods

## Results
- NSC(leaves) > NSC(belowground) > NSC(stem)
- NSC varies with plant functional type
- seasonal NSC oscillations
- minimum NSC between 30% and 50% of seasonal maximum

## Discussion
- imbalance between photosynthesis and C demands not only reason for NSC seasonal patterns
- soluble sugars seldom depleted suggesting that it serves important immediate physiological functions
- neutral lipids (not measured) can comprise almost half of total NSC in some species

## Conclusion
- dual function of NSC as storage (starch) and performing immediate physiological functions (soluble sugars)
- plants exhibit relatively high NSC thresholds, **mortality should occur when NSC falls below these thresholds, even in non-stressed plants**
- dual function with soluble sugar to starch conversion would have to be explicitly modeled

## My remarks
- in ACGCA NSC to biomass ratio is constant for fine roots and leaves and cannot be used for regrowth, so we assume it is needed for metabolism somehow
- in stem, NSC lever is supposed to be lower, nevertheless, some threshold should not be undershot- let's say half of the leaves-fine root average is the normal stem NSC average, then say half of it is needed as soluble sugars:
\begin{equation}
    \nonumber
    \min\delta_S = \frac{1}{4}\,\frac{\delta_L+\rho_{RL}\,\delta_R}{1+\rho_{RL}} \\approx 0.02
\end{equation}
