## Friday, 2024-07-12, 13:30
The official ceremony will take place at 13:30 at the [castle in Neuhaus-Schierschnitz](https://www.coburg-rennsteig.de/poi/burg-neuhaus).
**Guests are supposed to arrive not later than 13:00.**
The ceremony will last about 45-60 minutes.

- **People**
    The castle allows no more than 50 guests, which means that some party guests will not be able to follow the official ceremony.
    Please carefully check your invitation.

- **Location**
    The location is a castle from the 14th century, which comes with some consequences.
    For once, it is located on a small hill and parking is allowed only at the foot of the hill, directly after the entrance gate.
    Only in special cases cars are allowed to drive all the way up to the castle, for instance to deliver bride and groom and other people who can walk badly uphill.
    Please get in touch with us if you needs to drive all the way up.
    Keep in mind that an uphill walk of about five minutes can become cumbersome depending on the type of shoes you choose.

- **Food**
    None.

- **Beverages**
    The [Förderverein Burg Neuhaus](https://foerderverein-burg-neuhaus.de/) will offer beer and alcohol-free beverages as well as some champaign after the ceremony.

- **Children**
    Because of the strict limitation to 50 guests at the castle, we cannot allow children at the castle, except for those belonging directly to the family (Felix, Clara, Basti, Amelie).
    We will organize somebody who takes care of the children at the hotel during the ceremony at the castle.
    If you are willing to support us here or have any question or comments, please get in touch with us.

- **Transportation**
    We will organize the transport from the hotel to the castle with departure at the hotel at 12:45.
    Guests who organize their arrival to the castle on their own are adivsed not to arrive later than 13:00 at the castle.
    Private parking is allowed only at the parking lot at the foot of the castle hill directly after the entrance gate to the right.
    After the ceremony there will be an organized service to bring the guests back to the hotel to the wedding party.

    Please let us know whether you plan to use the organized transportation service to or from the castle or both to simplify our planning.

## Transportation to and from the hotel
To arrive at the hotel from any airport in Germany is to be conceived of an adventure.
From personal experience, the easiest arrival to the hotel from any airport in Germany is from Munich (or even better, if you find a flight that lands there, Nuremberg).

The train station closest to the hotel is the station **[Stockheim (Oberfr.)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/96342+Stockheim,+Germany/@50.3068948,11.2814374,17.96z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47a162d0c96bc825:0x12f2c3af610540a9!8m2!3d50.3067809!4d11.2818069!16s%2Fm%2F02q3zjx?authuser=0&entry=ttu)**.
Please do not be shocked if it does not look like you would imagine a train station, it's basically just a stop in the middle of nowhere.
The station is not barrier-free, please inform us if you require a barrier-free solution.
Please be aware that there are several different train stops in Germany called **Stockheim**.
Make sure to select the right one, as mentioned above.
This train station is also not served by high-speed trains (ICE), so at some point you will have to change to a regional train (RE = Regional-Express, or the slowest version RB = Regional-Bahn).

From there, a hotel shuttle service can pick you up for 15,- € if you have informed the hotel in advance about your arrival time by also mentioning our wedding (Metzler and Guardia Velarde).
Walking from the train station to the hotel is no viable option.
Please tell the hotel staff about any unexpected changes as soon as possible.
Changes on short notice are best done by phone, the staff speaks English.

**Attention**: Please be aware that no matter at which airport you land, it will take you several hours (probably at least four to five, it can easily be more) to reach the hotel.
If you plan to attend any event of our wedding party, we would advise you to plan one entire day for the travel the day before that event.

### Deutsche Bahn
General information on ICE, the DB Navigator App, etc.

### Munich airport
If you land at **Munich airport**, you can take the S-Bahn (which looks like a train) from the S-Bahn station right outside the airport to reach **Munich central station**.
At the airport just follow the signs with a white S on green ground.
For instance, lines S1 and S8 serve the central station.

From Munich central station, your next step is to reach **Nuremberg**.
To that end, you can either take RE1 or an ICE.

From Nuremberg, the best option is to take RE14 toward either Saalfeld or Halle or Leipzig (last time it said Saalfeld).
This train will bring you to your final train destination **Stockheim (Oberfr.)**.

### Tipps and tricks

- In Germany the use of cash (€) is very common. Most of the times you will be able to pay by card, but it is safe to always have some cash available.
