## Friday, 2024-07-12, 13:30
The official ceremony will take place at 13:30 at the [castle in Neuhaus-Schierschnitz](https://www.coburg-rennsteig.de/poi/burg-neuhaus).
**Guests are supposed to arrive no later than 13:00.**
The ceremony will last about 45-60 minutes.

- **People**
    The castle allows no more than 50 guests, which means that some party guests will not be able to follow the official ceremony.
    Please carefully check your invitation.

- **Location**
    The location is a castle from the 14th century, which comes with some consequences.
    For once, it is located on a small hill and parking is allowed only at the foot of the hill, directly after the entrance gate.
    Only in special cases cars are allowed to drive all the way up to the castle, for instance to deliver bride and groom and other people who can walk badly uphill.
    Please get in touch with us if you needs to drive all the way up.
    Keep in mind that an uphill walk of about five minutes can become cumbersome depending on the type of shoes you choose.

- **Food**
    None.

- **Beverages**
    The [Förderverein Burg Neuhaus](https://foerderverein-burg-neuhaus.de/) will offer beer and alcohol-free beverages as well as some champaign after the ceremony.

- **Children**
    Because of the strict limitation to 50 guests at the castle, we cannot allow children at the castle, except for those belonging directly to the family (Felix, Clara, Basti, Amelie).
    We will organize somebody who takes care of the children at the hotel during the ceremony at the castle.
    If you are willing to support us here or have any question or comments, please get in touch with us.

- **Transportation**
    We will organize the transport from the hotel to the castle with departure at the hotel at 12:45.
    Guests who organize their arrival to the castle on their own are adivsed not to arrive later than 13:00 at the castle.
    Private parking is allowed only at the parking lot at the foot of the castle hill directly after the entrance gate to the right.
    After the ceremony there will be an organized service to bring the guests back to the hotel to the wedding party.

    Please let us know whether you plan to use the organized transportation service to or from the castle or both to simplify our planning.

## Transportation to and from the hotel
To arrive at the hotel from any airport in Germany is to be conceived of an adventure.
From personal experience, the easiest arrival to the hotel from any airport in Germany is from Munich (or even better, if you find a flight that lands there, Nuremberg).

The train station closest to the hotel is the station **[Stockheim (Oberfr)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/96342+Stockheim,+Germany/@50.3068948,11.2814374,17.96z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47a162d0c96bc825:0x12f2c3af610540a9!8m2!3d50.3067809!4d11.2818069!16s%2Fm%2F02q3zjx?authuser=0&entry=ttu)**.
Please do not be shocked if it does not look like you would imagine a train station, it's basically just a stop in the middle of nowhere.
The station is not barrier-free, please inform us if you require a barrier-free solution.
Please be aware that there are several different train stops in Germany called *Stockheim*.
Make sure to select the right one, as mentioned above.
This train station is also not served by high-speed trains (ICE), so at some point you will have to change to a regional train (RE = Regional-Express or the slowest version RB = Regional-Bahn).

From there, a hotel shuttle service can pick you up for 15,- € if you have informed the hotel in advance about your arrival time by also mentioning our wedding (Metzler and Guardia Velarde).
Walking from the train station to the hotel is no viable option.
Please tell the hotel staff about any unexpected changes as soon as possible.
Changes on short notice are best done by phone, the staff speaks English.

**Hotel contact** <info@hotel-rebhan.de>, +49 (0) 9265 955 6100

**Attention** Please be aware that no matter at which airport you land, it will take you several hours (probably at least four to five, it can easily be more) to reach the hotel.
If you plan to attend any event of our wedding party, we would advise you to plan one entire day for the travel the day before that event.

### Deutsche Bahn (DB)
In recent years DB has developed into a trademark for being late and unreliable.
Most recently, they discovered their passion for strikes.
Luckily, our wedding will take place between the semifinals (Wednesday, 2024-07-10) and the final (Sunday, 2024-07-14) of the European Football Championship in Germany.
So we are positive that trains (and also flights) will be more reliable than usual.

Planning trips with DB and buying tickets works best from their [website](https://int.bahn.de/en) or from the **DB Navigator App** ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/db-navigator/id343555245), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.db&hl=sv&pli=1)).
Both offer an English language option.

Fast trains are called Intercity Express (ICE) and are usually quite expensive when considered on short notice.
The earlier you book the more likely it is that you will be able to grab a reasonable special price.
Such special prices, however, usually come with the disadvantage of *Zugbindung*, which means that you are entitled to take only those particular trains mentioned on the ticket.
In case of cancellations and delays you can talk to the personnel and they will liberate you from this restriction.

Slower and cheaper trains are called Regional-Express (RE) and Regional-Bahn (RB). REs are usually quite fast, while RBs stop at every village.
In order to get to **Stockheim (Oberfr)** you will have to take either an RE or an RB for the last part of your trip.
REs become particularly handy from Munich.

DB offers the so-called **[Bayern-Ticket](https://int.bahn.de/en/offers/regional/regional-day-ticket-bavaria)**, which is valid from 9:00 in the morning until 3:00 in the morning for up to five persons (1 person = 29 €, 5 persons = 69 €).
This ticket has the only restriction that you cannot use fast trains (ICEs).
However, it covers the S-Bahn from Munich airport to Munich central station, and all REs or RBs from Munich via Nuremberg to Stockheim (Oberfr).

Both on the website and in the DB Navigator App, the default setting is *Show fastest connections*.
This will automatically show you all connections that include an ICE and sometimes surpress the connections that you are allowed to use with the *Bayern-Ticket*.
It can be of good use to deactivate this default option.
Our recent experience also showed that it was useful to explicitly add stopovers at Munich central station and Nuremberg, coming from Munich airport.

Other train types are Intercity (IC, without express) and Eurocity (EC).
Neither of the two would be covered by the *Bayern-Ticket*.

### Munich airport (MUC)
If you land at **Munich airport**, you can take the S-Bahn (which looks like a train) from the S-Bahn station right outside the airport to reach **Munich central station**.
At the airport just follow the signs with a white S on green ground.
For instance, lines S1 and S8 serve the central station.

From Munich central station, your next step is to reach **Nuremberg**.
To that end, you can either take RE1 or an ICE.

From Nuremberg, the best option is to take RE14 toward either Saalfeld or Halle or Leipzig (last time it said Saalfeld).
This train will bring you to your final train destination **Stockheim (Oberfr)**.

Please carefully check available train connections that can match your airport arrival times on the DB website or in the DB Navigator App.

---

<br>

### Frankfurt airport (FRA)
From Frankfurt airport, always aim for **Bamberg**.
From Bamberg you can take RE 14 to **Stockheim (Oberf)**.
Possible ways to reach Bamberg are direct ICEs, ICEs to **Würzburg** with subsequent ICE, RE, or RB to Bamberg.
Another option is to take S8 to **Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof** and from there RE55 to Bamerg.

Please carefully check available train connections that can match your airport arrival times on the DB website or in the DB Navigator App.

<br>

### Berlin airport (BER)
From Berlin airport your first goal should be either **Berlin Südkreuz** or **Berlin central station**.
They are one stop apart from each other, first you would get to Südkreuz, but maybe you like the central station with way more shopping and food options more.
This first stage can sometimes be achieved by an IC or by an RE (e.g., RE8 or RE17).

In case you book early and can get an affordable ICE ticket, then your next stop would be **Bamberg** (take an ICE toward Munich).
From Bamberg you then take RE14 toward Saalfeld and get off in **Stockheim (Oberf)**.
Connections without ICE are highly flexible, probably adventerous, and not recommendable.
A possible connection could look like 

- Berlin central station - Erfurt - Saalfeld - Stockheim (Oberfr)

Coming from Berlin you should always aim at reaching either Saalfeld or Bamberg and continue from there with RE14 to Stockheim (Oberf), wich is located in the middle between Saalfeld and Bamberg.
Resonable intermediate stops could be Wittenberg, Erfurt, Halle (an der Saale), Jena, Leipzig, Chemnitz.

Please carefully check available train connections that can match your airport arrival times on the DB website or in the DB Navigator App.

### Good to know

- In Germany the use of cash (€) is very common. Most of the times you will be able to pay by card, but it is safe to always have some cash available. 
- Germany is mostly an Uber-free zone, only regular taxis officially exist.
