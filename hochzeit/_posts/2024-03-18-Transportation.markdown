## Transportation to and from the hotel
To arrive at the hotel from any airport in Germany is to be conceived of an adventure.
From personal experience, the easiest arrival to the hotel from any airport in Germany is from Munich (or even better, if you find a flight that lands there, Nuremberg).

The train station closest to the hotel is the station **[Stockheim (Oberfr)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/96342+Stockheim,+Germany/@50.3068948,11.2814374,17.96z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47a162d0c96bc825:0x12f2c3af610540a9!8m2!3d50.3067809!4d11.2818069!16s%2Fm%2F02q3zjx?authuser=0&entry=ttu)**.
Please beware that although it might not look like a regular train station, it is one.
The station is not barrier-free, please inform us if you require a barrier-free solution.
Please be aware that there are several different train stops in Germany called *Stockheim*.
Make sure to select the right one, as mentioned above.
This train station is also not served by high-speed trains (ICE), so at some point you will have to change to a regional train (RE = Regional-Express or the slowest version RB = Regional-Bahn).

From there, walking to the hotel is not a viable option.
Please organize a pick-up service with the hotel mentioning the wedding of Metzler and Guardia Velarde.
Please tell the hotel staff about any unexpected changes as soon as possible.
Changes on short notice are best done by phone, the staff speaks English.

**Attention** Please be aware that no matter at which airport you land, it will take you several hours (probably at least four to five, it can easily be more) to reach the hotel.
If you plan to attend any event of our wedding party, we would advise you to plan one entire day for the travel the day before that event.

### Deutsche Bahn (DB)
Although DB is not always as reliable as one would expect, luckily our wedding will take place between the semifinals and the final of the European Football Championship in Germany.
So we are positive that trains (and also flights) will be on time.

Planning trips with DB and buying tickets works best from their [website](https://int.bahn.de/en) or from the **DB Navigator App** ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/db-navigator/id343555245), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.db&hl=sv&pli=1)).
Both offer an English language option.

Fast trains are called Intercity Express (ICE) and the earlier you book them the better are your chances to be offered a reasonable (special) price.
Such special prices, however, usually come with the disadvantage of *Zugbindung*, which means that you are entitled to take only those particular trains mentioned on the ticket.
In case of cancellations and delays you can talk to the personnel and they will liberate you from this restriction.

Slower and usually cheaper trains are called Regional-Express (RE) and Regional-Bahn (RB). REs are usually quite fast, while RBs stop at every village.
In order to get to **Stockheim (Oberfr)** you will have to take either an RE or an RB for the last part of your trip.
REs become particularly handy from Munich.

DB offers the so-called **[Bayern-Ticket](https://int.bahn.de/en/offers/regional/regional-day-ticket-bavaria)**, which is valid from 9:00 in the morning until 3:00 in the morning of the next days for up to five persons (1 person = 29 €, 5 persons = 69 €).
This ticket has the only restriction that you cannot use fast trains (ICEs).
However, it covers the S-Bahn from Munich airport to Munich central station, and all REs or RBs from Munich via Nuremberg to Stockheim (Oberfr).

Both on the website and in the DB Navigator App, the default setting is *Show fastest connections*.
This will automatically show you all connections that include an ICE and sometimes surpress the connections that you are allowed to use with the *Bayern-Ticket*.
It can be of good use to deactivate this default option.
Our recent experience also showed that it was useful to explicitly add stopovers at Munich central station and Nuremberg, coming from Munich airport.

Other train types are Intercity (IC, without express) and Eurocity (EC).
Neither of the two would be covered by the *Bayern-Ticket*.

### Munich airport (MUC)
If you land at **Munich airport**, you can take the S-Bahn (which looks like a train) from the S-Bahn station right outside the airport to reach **Munich central station**.
At the airport just follow the signs with a white S on green ground.
For instance, lines S1 and S8 serve the central station.

From Munich central station, your next step is to reach **Nuremberg**.
To that end, you can either take RE1 or an ICE.

From Nuremberg, the best option is to take RE14 toward Saalfeld.
This train will bring you to your final train destination **Stockheim (Oberfr)**.

Please carefully check available train connections that can match your airport arrival times on the DB website or in the DB Navigator App.

### Frankfurt airport (FRA)
From Frankfurt airport, always aim for **Bamberg**.
From Bamberg you can take RE14 to **Stockheim (Oberf)**.
Possible ways to reach Bamberg are direct ICEs, ICEs to **Würzburg** with subsequent ICE, RE, or RB to Bamberg.
Another option is to take S8 to **Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof** and from there RE55 to Bamerg.

Please carefully check available train connections that can match your airport arrival times on the DB website or in the DB Navigator App.

### Berlin airport (BER)
From Berlin airport your first goal should be either **Berlin Südkreuz** or **Berlin central station**.
They are one stop apart from each other, first you would get to Südkreuz, but maybe you like the central station with way more shopping and food options more.
This first stage can sometimes be achieved by an IC, an RE, or an S (e.g., RE8 or RE17).

In case you book early and can get an affordable ICE ticket, then your next stop would be **Bamberg** (take an ICE toward Munich).
From Bamberg you then take RE14 toward Saalfeld and get off in **Stockheim (Oberf)**.
Connections without ICE are not recommendable, but could look like 

- Berlin central station - Erfurt - Saalfeld - Stockheim (Oberfr)

Coming from Berlin you should always aim at reaching either Saalfeld or Bamberg and continue from there with RE14 to Stockheim (Oberf), wich is located in the middle between Saalfeld and Bamberg.
Resonable intermediate stops could be Wittenberg, Erfurt, Halle (an der Saale), Jena, Leipzig, Chemnitz.

Please carefully check available train connections that can match your airport arrival times on the DB website or in the DB Navigator App.
