## Accommodation

We recommend to plan your stay at [Rebhan's Business und Wellness Hotel](https://hotel-rebhan.de/?lang=en) in Neukenroth/Stockheim, where also the wedding party will take place.
From there we will organize shuttle transfer to and from the sports ground on Thursday as well as to and from the wedding ceremony at the castle on Friday.
We have reserved a number of rooms for the wedding.
You can book one of those rooms by getting in touch with the hotel and mentioning the wedding of Metzler and Guardia Velarde, according to their price list.
There are single and double rooms are available and extra beds can be added on request.

**Hotel contact** <info@hotel-rebhan.de>, +49 (0) 9265 955 6100

Of course, you also have the option to organize your accomodation on your own in whatever place suits you.
In that case, please take into account that we cannot guarantee a simple means of transportation among the different party locations.
