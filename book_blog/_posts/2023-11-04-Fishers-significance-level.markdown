The textbook example of the null hypothesis is the flip of a coin.
Each coin flipped has a fifty-fifty chance of landing on heads or tails.
According to the lat of large numbers, one has to repeat the flip many times in order to achieve the expected 1:1 ratio of heads to tails.
How many times?
The consensual number, twenty, was theorized by the statistician an geneticist Ronald Fisher.
According to Fisher's significance level, nineteen tails in a row may still be due to chance, but twent signifies a loaded coin.
In experimental science, results obtained twenty times are said to be signfiicant, refuting the null hypothesis.

**Something is wrong her with the math, isn't it?**
Under the null hypothesis, the probability of having nineteen tails in a row is $(1/2)^{19}$, which is much smaller than $0.05$.
So we would already reject the null hypothesis.
Actually $2^5=32>20$, five tails in a row would be enough to reject the null hypothesis. That does not sound right either.
