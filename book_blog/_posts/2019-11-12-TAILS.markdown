I took along a chep laptop running TAILS, which is a LINUX-based "amnesiac" operating system - meaning it forgets everything when you turn it off, and starts fresh when you boot it up again, with no logs or memory traces of anything ever done on it.
TAILS allowed me to easily "spoof", or disguise, the laptop's MAC: whenever it connected to a network it left behind the record of some other machine, in no way associable with mine.
Useful enough, TAILS also had built-in support for connecting to the anonymizing Tor network.
