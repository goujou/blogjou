Aversion to neutrality is also embedded in language.
In Enlish, neutrality is expressed through the cancellation of other states.
One may be nonaligned, disinterested, detached, unbiased, asexual, indifferent, or impartial.
In this way, neutrality is coded as exceptional rather than normal.
The normal state is one of preference or tendency, and neutrality is its negation.
Linguists would describe neutrality as marked, which is to say uncommon, while the absence of neutrality is unmarked.
