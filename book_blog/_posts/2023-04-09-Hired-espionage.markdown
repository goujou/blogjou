Besides, for the US in particular, when the 9/11 attacks generated a sudden and irresistable demand for intelligende support for the 'War on Terror', this was the only way an intelligence community that had suffered a decade of contraction could respond rapidly. You cannot train officers to speak Farsi or pivot them from Kyiv to Kabul overnight, but you can hope to hire that existing expertise. Short-term response become long-term dependency, though: as a 2007 presentation from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put it, 'We can't spy ... if we wan't buy!'
