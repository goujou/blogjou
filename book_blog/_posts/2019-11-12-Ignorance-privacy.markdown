There is simply no way to ignore privacy.
Because citizenry's freedoms are interdependent, to surrender your own privacy is really to surrender everyone's.
You might choose to give it up for convenience, or under the popular pretext that privacy is only required by those who have something to hide.
But saying that you don't need or want privacy because you have nothing to hide is to assume that no one should have, or could have [...].
You assume that no one, including yourself, might object to revealing to anyone information about [...].
Ultimately, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.
Or that you don't care about freedom of the press because you don't like to read.
Or that you don't care about freedom of religion because you don't believe in God.
Or that you don't care about the freedom to peacefully assemble because you're a lazy, antisocial agoraphobe.
Just because this or that freedom might not have meaning for you **today** doesn't mean that it doesn't or won't have meaning **tomorrow**, to you, or to your neighbor [...].
