The palette of the hill is red with moss, pink from the granite, bright green with shoots of blaeberry, the orange and red and white of lichen, all set against the blanket grey of heavy rainclouds pressing down.
Below me the forest is an unending green, punctuated by trucks on the highway and the iron grey of the River Spey looping through the trees.
Far off are the bare burned-brown grouse moors and the geometric blocks of plantations that now appear to me to have all the implied violence of brutalist concrete architecture.
