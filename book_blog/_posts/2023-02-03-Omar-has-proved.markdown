Omar has proved a lot of myths to be wrong or misleading. 'Teams hoping to get promoted from the Championship should employ players with experience of playing in that league' is not true if you look at the numbers. 'Managers should get their teams to play more aggressively' is an unqualifiable and meaningless statement. 'The wage bill in the Premier League team determines results' is only true for the gap between the 'big six' and the rest of the league. Teams outside the big six can do well on smaller budgets. 'The success of Spain and Barcelona means that clubs should look for shorter players' is no established by research. Instead, there is a risk that teams get caught up in a rush to follow fads. Myth after myth fails when Omar starts to do his statistical checks.
