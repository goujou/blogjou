A Scots pine seed looks a bit like the wing of an insect, with a hard seed case and a long papery wing acting like a sail to catch the breeze.
The seed endosperm crop is an essential food source for crossbills, siskins, tits, woodpeckers and red squirrels.
Red squirrels shred the scales to get at the seeds, eating up to 200 cones a day.
