The next step is to understand what is important to you and your hapiness.
This isn't always as easy as we mght think, because most of us have been conditioned from an early age to 'know' what we should and shouldn't want.
If you're a parent, you'll appreciate the almost instantaneous guilt you feel the moment you take a second to breathe, let alone take a whole day to yourself.
This isn't about what your parent, partner, friends or children want for you or what they think you should want for yourself.
This is about whay *you* want and what you need to change or stop doing in order to get it.
To be the best parent, parter or friend when the plane is going down you need to put your own oxygen mask on first.
