And I explain more thoroughly the idea of the two evolutions.
The first, concering qualitative variation, is in the province of Darwinism and adaptation.
The second, concerning quantitative variation, is in the province of the good enough and neutrality.
Again, natural selection is real; adaptation is real.
But much that distinguishes organisms from one another, particularly differences in size, is not adaptive.
These variations are not selected; they are tolerated.
