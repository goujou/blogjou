Partisans of intelligent design argue in bad faith, so they might still claim my views on behalf of their mistaken ideas.
In fact, my arguments vitiate theirs; there is a strong corellation between the uqiquity of neutrality and the falseness of intelligent design.
That is because intelligent design is parasitic on selectionism.
Intelligent design begins from the premise, supplied by selectionism, that species are optimized.
ntelligent design takes Darwin's analogy to domestication as more than figurative, asking how the perfection of nature - or, in Wallace's case, the human specifically - could possibly be achieved without the intervention and direction of an intelligent force, a great cosmic breeder or sculptor.
In contrast to both selectionism and intelligent design, the theory of the good enough turns our attention to nature's many imperfections.
Because nature is not optimzed, intelligent design advocates are actually assigning waste and mediocrity to the handiwork of an omnipotent being of supernatural intelligence. Why venerate such a lazy and inept God?
When we temper our selectionist expectations, the absurdity of intelligent design emerges in even sharper belief.
