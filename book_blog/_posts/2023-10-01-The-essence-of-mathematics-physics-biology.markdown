Again, I question the roles of novelty and merit in the selection process.
But though I come to this subject from my same philosophical perspective, I might add that there aee serious and even trailblazing biologists on my side.
True, none of them has offered a comprehensive complementary theory to explain what Darwin and his followers leave out.
Even so, I take heart from the words of Sydney Brenner, who won the Nobel Prize for his efforts in discovering messenger RNA (mRNA).
"Wheras," Brenner explains, "mathematics is the art of the perfect and physics the art of the optimal, biology, because of evolution, is only the art of the satisfactory."
Species need not be perfect or optimal, only satifactory.
Fancois Jacob opposes in his autobiography Jacques Monod's Cartesian idea of nature to his: "I saw nature as a rather good girl. Generous, but a little dirty. A little messy. Working in a piecemeal way. Doing what she could with what she found."
