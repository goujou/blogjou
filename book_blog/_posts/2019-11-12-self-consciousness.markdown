I think averybody has had this kind of experience: the more conscious you are of being recorded, the more self-conscious you become.
Merely the awareness that there is, or might be, somebody pressing Record on their smartphone and pointing it at you can cause awkwardness, even if that somebody is a friend.
Though today nearly all my interactions take place via camera, I'm still not sure which experience I find more alienating: seeing myself on film or being filmed.
I try to avoid the former, but avoiding the latter is now difficult for everyone.
