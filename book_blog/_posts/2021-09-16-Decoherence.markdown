If the interference between each pair of coarse grained histories is zero, either exactly or to an exceedingly good approximation, then all the coarse grained histories are said to *decohere*.
The quantity $D$ of each coarse-grained history and itself is then a true probability, with the additive property.
In practice, quantum mechanics is always applied to sets of decohering coarse-grained histories, and that is why it is able to predict probabilities.
($D$, by the way, is called the *decoherence functional*; the wod "functional" indicates that it depends on histories.)
