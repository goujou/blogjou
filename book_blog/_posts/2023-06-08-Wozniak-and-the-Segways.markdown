After about five and a half hours of watching magic shows with the Wozniaksm we headed out of the club toward the valet. We handed our stub to the attendantm but the Wozniaks just kept walking toward the dark parking lot.

- ME: You guys didn't valet?
- WOZ: No. Actually, we Segwayed.
- LAUREN: You what?
- WOZ: Segwayed! We're staying at the W hotel a few miles up Hollywood Boulevard, so we just Segwayed here. Wanna see?
ME: Uh...yeah?

They led us across the parking lot to a corner where, propped against a little shed, were two old Segways.

- ME: Bet you got on the Segway bandwagon pretty early?
- WOZ: Oh, you bet! These are the first Segways! See?!

He showed me the serial numbers on the handlebars: 001 and 002.

- ME: Wow! The first two Segways!
- WOZ: Yeah! The only thing is, they didn't create any sort of headlight till later models, so we have to use these.

He pulled two flashlights out of his jacket pocket and gave one to his wife. With one hand operating the Segway, the other holding a flashlight, they drove off, looking as silly and happy as two people could.
