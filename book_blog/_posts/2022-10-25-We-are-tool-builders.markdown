> I think one of the things that really separates us from the higher primates is that we're tool builders.
I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet.
The cCondor used the least amount of energy to move a kilometre.
And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list.
It was not too proud of a showing for the crown of creation.
That didn't look so good.
But then, somebody at Scientific american had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle.
And a man on a bicycle completely blew the condor away, completely off the top of the chart.
