The UN pays a flat fee of around <span>$</span>1,500 per soldier per month, but to the state providing the force, not the individual grund on the ground. That would not cover the basic pay and provisions of a British Army private but compares very favourably with an Ethiopian average salary of $275 per month, and the government can pocket the difference between what the UN provides and what it pays its men.
