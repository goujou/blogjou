It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvellous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different plants, and all these atoms with all their motions and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good or evil - which is the view that religion has.
The stage is too big for the drama.
So I believe it's not the right picture.
