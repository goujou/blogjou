Posterity tends to make its choices with the help of two heuristics.
One in incumbency bias: the earlier one enters the pantheon, the harder he or she is to expell, no matter the quality of the work celebrated.
The other is laziness bias: posterity tends to select those who were already recognized by their own contemporaries; a lifetime of success is an important, if not strictly necessary, condition for posthumois lionization.
Rare exceptions such as Gregory Mendel will console only inveterate optimists.
