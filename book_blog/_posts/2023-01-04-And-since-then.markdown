Oh, since then I've travelled and seen the world. There's damned little equality going about. Mind you, I still believe in democracy. But you've got to force it on peaople with a strong hand - ram it down their throats. Men don't want to be brothers - they may some day, but they don't now. My belief in the brotherhood of man died when I arrived in London last week, when I observed people standing in a Tube train resolutely refuse to move up and make room for those who entered. You won't turn people into angels by appealing to their better natures just yet awhile - but by judicious force you can coerce them into behaving more or less decently to one another to go on with. I still believe in the brotherhood of man, but it's not coming yet awhile. Say another ten thousand years or so. It's no good being impatient. Evolution is a slow process.
