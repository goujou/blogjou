One of the most viewed TED talsk, by Bren√© Brown, is titled 'The Power of Vulnerability'.
As a researcher, Brown wanted to find out what truly 'connected' people had in common, and she discovered they had a shared willingness to be open to vulnerability.
This openness allowed them to make deep personal connections, because the places where we experience fear and vulnerability are the same places where we will find our dreams, along with increadible experiences of love and joy.
