It's not like other religions in that way. Even if you don't believe in Judaism, you, my friend, are still a Jew. You can't really opt out of it.

Maybe that's why Jews are Jew*ish*. It's more vague and casts a wider net than other religions. "I'm a Hindu." "I'm a Muslim." "I'm Jew...ish." Less commitment is involved when "ish" is in the mix. I'm not starving. I'm hungry-ish. I'm not freezing. Im cold-ish. I'm not a Jew, but I'm fore sure Jew*ish*.
