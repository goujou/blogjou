intro: "When reading books I have the habit to endlessly mark the most impressive phrases, paragraphs, and pages with post-its.
While in the past I haved already missed out too many of them to be organized and stored, I have finally managed to find a way to collect current and future post-it bookmarks in a structured way.

While most of blogjou is in English, here I just quote the text in the language I read the book."
